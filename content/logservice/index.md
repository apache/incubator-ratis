The Ratis LogService is an distributed, log implementation built on top of Apache
Ratis. The LogService is a "recipe" on top of Apache Ratis, providing a higher-level
API as compared to Ratis itself. The LogService provides the ability to create named,
durable, append-only data structures with the ability to perform linear reads.

Like Ratis, the LogService is designed to be embedded into another application as
a library, as opposed to a standalone daemon. On a confusing note, there are Java
daemons provided for the LogService, but these are solely to be used for testing.
