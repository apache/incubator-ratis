      <description>The LogService is a system which manages a collection of logs. Each of these logs has a defined state which allows certain operations on that log or corresponds to actions that the system is taking on that log.
OPEN This is the first state for a Log which is created in the LogService. A Log which is OPEN can be read from or written to. This Log has a corresponding Raft Group (a quorum of servers) who are participating in the hosting of this Log.</description>

      <description>The Ratis LogService is an distributed, log implementation built on top of Apache Ratis. The LogService is a &amp;ldquo;recipe&amp;rdquo; on top of Apache Ratis, providing a higher-level API as compared to Ratis itself. The LogService provides the ability to create named, durable, append-only data structures with the ability to perform linear reads.
Like Ratis, the LogService is designed to be embedded into another application as a library, as opposed to a standalone daemon.</description>

      <description>This document aims to describe what the intended security deployment model of the Ratis LogService.
We will use integration into Apache HBase as an exemplar.
Background TLS is technology capable of giving us &amp;ldquo;strong authentication&amp;rdquo; over network communication. One-way TLS can provide encrypted communication while two-way or &amp;ldquo;mutual&amp;rdquo; TLS can provide encrypted communication and authentication.
One feature of Ratis is that it is decoupled from the RPC transport in use. gRPC is the foremost transport, and can be configured to use one-way or two-way/mutual TLS.</description>
